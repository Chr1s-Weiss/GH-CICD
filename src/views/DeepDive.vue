      <h2>Introduction to CI/CD Pipelines</h2>
      <p>
        CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or
        Continuous Deployment. It is a set of practices and tools used
        in software development to automate the process of building,
        testing, and deploying applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CI/CD production pipeline streamlines the software
        development process by automating various stages, starting
        from code changes to the final deployment. It ensures that code
        changes are tested thoroughly, integrated seamlessly, and deployed
        consistently.
      </p>

      <p>
        To set up a CI/CD production pipeline, you typically follow
        these steps:
      </p>

      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align: justify;">
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align: justify;">
          Version Control: Use a version control system like Git to
          manage your codebase effectively.
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align: justify;">
          Automated Builds: Configure your pipeline to automatically
          build your software whenever changes are made to the code
          repository.
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align: justify;">
          Automated Testing: Implement automated tests to validate the
          functionality, performance, and security of your application.
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align: justify;">
          Continuous Integration: Integrate code changes frequently
          into a shared repository to identify and resolve conflicts early.
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align: justify;">
          Continuous Delivery/Deployment: Automate the process of
          packaging and deploying your application to various environments,
          such as development, staging, and production.
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align: justify;">
          Monitoring and Feedback: Set up monitoring tools to track the
          performance and health of your application in real-time. Gather
          feedback from users to improve the software continuously.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The CI/CD production pipeline works by constantly monitoring the
        code repository for changes. Whenever a change is detected, it
        triggers a series of automated steps, such as building the
        software, running tests, and deploying the application. This
        automation reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and allows
        for faster and more reliable software releases.
      </p>
      <p>
        By implementing a CI/CD production pipeline, development teams
        can achieve several benefits, including faster time-to-market,
        improved code quality, increased collaboration, and easier
        rollbacks in case of issues. It promotes a culture of continuous
        improvement and helps deliver software in a more efficient and
        consistent manner.

      <h2>My Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        My motivation for choosing 'CI/CD pipelines' as the focus of my
        Deep Dive project stems from their fundamental role within agile
        software development teams. These pipelines serve as cornerstones
        for efficient software development practices. By integrating
        CI/CD pipelines, organizations can significantly speed up the
        process of introducing new features, fixing bugs and delivering
        updated software to end users. This improvement not only promotes
        rapid development, but also speeds up the feedback loop.
        <br>
        In addition, a number of companies have adopted CI/CD pipelines as
        a core part of their production processes. In preparation for my
        upcoming internship, I am very interested in gaining a thorough
        understanding of how these pipelines work in real-world scenarios.

      <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
      <p>
        This week I want to acquire the skills needed to set up the essential
        components of a CI/CD production pipeline in a Github test
        environment. In this comprehensive process, I focus on setting
        up version control and enabling continuous deployment. At the
        same time, I intend to create a small Vue project using Vite as
        a local development server. This project serves a dual purpose:
        it will comprehensively evaluate the functionality of the CI/CD
        pipeline and adhere to best coding practices to simultaneously
        improve my programming skills. I plan to complete this project
        by Sunday noon.

      <h2>Project Plan</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Monday</strong>
        served as orientation day. On Monday I defined the goal
        for the week and did research about how this challenge can be talked
        and what is the best way to start in order to save valuable time in
        the following days.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>Tuesday</strong>
        research and implementation day. Knowing what type of
        technology I wanted to use I started doing specific research about how
        to setup the Pipeline in Github and combine it with Github-Pages.
        Afterwards, I started the Implementation by setting up a new Vue-Project
        using Vite as local development server and connecting it to a newly
        created Github repository.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>Wednesday</strong>
        I finished the CD pipeline and started working on the Vue project.
        Additionally, I did all the steps involved to create the project,
        github repository and CD pipeline again in order to get rid of
        unnecessary configurations and to internalize what I have learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Thursday</strong>
        was development day. I started working on the Vue project and tested
        the CD pipeline. The CD pipeline worked perfectly, but while I was
        setting up the linking between pages with router links, a best
        practice when it comes to Vue development, I encountered a SyntaxError.
        Unfortunately, I couldn't find the cause of the problem and spent the
        the rest of the day searching for answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Friday</strong>
        was the second development day. Ida started the day with a
        guided a learning reflection session. The results of this session can
        be found in the paragraph below. Afterwards, I was able to resolve
        the linking issue with the help of a colleague and finished the
        home-page of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Saturday</strong>
        was devoted to documentation. I developed the DeepDive page of the
        website and wrote the documentation simultaneously. Additionally,
        I gathered all the notes I took on the previous days and combined
        them to the final project documentation.

      <h2>Learning Reflection</h2>
      <h3>What did you learn about your own learning this week?</h3>
      <p>
        This week, I gained valuable insights into my learning process.
        Firstly, I observed that my goal-setting approach proved to be
        effective. I successfully accomplished my primary objective, which was
        establishing a continuous deployment pipeline, and subsequently, I
        continued to work on secondary goals, such as developing a project
        utilizing the newly
        set up pipeline. Regarding my learning style, I found that actively
        anticipating and acknowledging errors as part of the learning process
        was a beneficial strategy. It allowed me to remain patient and not
        become frustrated when encountering obstacles. Nevertheless, I
        recognize that there is room for improvement in terms of my working
        style.
      </p>
      <h3>What was difficult?</h3>
      <p>
        One of the challenges I encountered during this learning journey
        was the absence of a clear roadmap. Typically, when embarking on a
        project, I prefer to have a well-defined outline of the steps
        required to achieve the goal. In this instance, while I knew what
        I wanted to achieve, I struggled to formulate a concrete plan of
        action. The plan I initially developed was quite vague and lacked
        specificity.
      </p>
      <h3>What was easy?</h3>
      <p>
        On the positive side, I found that making swift decisions and
        promptly initiating work came naturally to me. Working from home
        proved to be advantageous in this regard, as it eliminated the time
        and distractions associated with commuting to a physical location
        like Kea. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that
        the second attempt at executing the project was notably easier. To
        gain a comprehensive understanding of setting up a continuous deployment
        pipeline, I chose to repeat the process, and this repetition proved to
        be remarkably straightforward and insightful.
      </p>
      <h3>Did you achieve the learning goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I achieved my primary learning goal.</p>
      <h3>What could you have done better?</h3>
      <p>
        Faster adaption and planning the following steps after I made
        initial progress.
      </p>
      <h3>What worked well that you will continue doing?</h3>
      <p>
        Taking the time to discover without setting a strict deadline. Having
        this attitude that the task is complete when I have understood the topic
        allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the subject.
